- ESLint warnings about using `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image>` (can be optimized later)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Test Locally:
1. Run: `npm run dev`
2. Open: http://localhost:3000
3. Connect wallet (MetaMask with BSC Testnet configured)
4. Test token burning and NFT minting

### To Deploy to Production:

1. **Deploy Contract to BSC Mainnet:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:mainnet
   ```
   - Update `.env` with mainnet contract address
   - Ensure wallet has BNB for gas fees

2. **Deploy Frontend to Vercel:**
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Import in Vercel dashboard
   - Add all environment variables from `.env`
   - Deploy!
